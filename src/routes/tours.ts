Booking the trip before this date will allow you to ride without any cars, enhancing the serene atmosphere of this incredible journey. If you venture out early enough, you'll be amazed by giant snow walls on both sides of the road, formed by plows clearing the way for the summer season â€“ a truly spectacular sight!`,

You'll be greeted by a lava-rock moonscape that spreads out before you for miles, a view unlike anything you've probably ever encountered on a bike ride. Along the way, you'll follow an 1860s wagon route and pass through Windy Point, where you'll get a great view of Mt. Washington and your first look at the vast, 2,000-year-old lava flow.`
