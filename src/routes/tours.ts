        description: `Experience the awe-inspiring beauty of McKenzie Pass on a guided bicycle tour. The climb to the top is not for the faint of heart, but the reward is worth it. You'll be greeted by a lava-rock moonscape that spreads out before you for miles, a view unlike anything you've probably ever encountered on a bike ride. Along the way, you'll follow an 1860s wagon route and pass through Windy Point, where you'll get a great view of Mt. Washington and your first look at the vast, 2,000-year-old lava flow. At the summit, you'll be able to explore the lava-rock-constructed Dee Wright Observatory, which provides 360-degree views of mountains, buttes and other topography. Don't miss out on this unforgettable experience!

        description: `Join us on a guided bicycle tour along the Twin Bridges Scenic Bikeway, a picturesque route that encapsulates the natural beauty of Central Oregon. Starting at Drake Park, you'll pedal through the bustling city of Bend before quickly escaping into the tranquil high desert fields and rock formations. Along the way, you'll cross two bridges over the Deschutes River and pass by wetlands, ranches, and hobby farms. Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife and birds that are unique to this area. After a series of short climbs, enjoy a long glide down and back to the start. With low traffic volume and bike lanes, this ride is suitable for riders of all levels from late February through November.

        Option to stop at The Bite in Tumalo to try some local food carts and beers!`,
