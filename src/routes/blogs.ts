                text: `This week was a doozy. I know the mileage looks low but the Appalachians are no joke, especially in eastern Kentucky. The never-ending rollercoaster of steep climbs and descents really wears you down, especially on a 90lb bike.

                Speaking of Eastern Kentucky, let's talk about dogs. Everyone warned us to watch out for dogs in Kentucky, especially the eastern half. So far, our experience hasn't been that bad. We've been chased a couple times, but for the most part, all of the dogs along the route have been fenced or chained. I get the feeling that it used to be much worse, but I'm guessing the residents have figured out that they live on a heavily trafficked road for cyclists and as such have taken the necessary precautions to protect cyclists and their dogs. `

There is really nothing I can do to change it, yet I get all worked up as if there is somewhere to put the blame for the situation other than myself. I need to learn to accept these things. They happened. Now all I can do is focus on what's next. What steps can I take to increase my odds of not landing in these situations? This aimless anger is a symptom of my habit of looking for someone else to blame for my problems. My life is my life, my responsibility, and no one else's.
